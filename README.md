## :detective: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis 

Let's clean the data set and do a first exporatory analysis to check what's the data look like. You can find the results in the Rmd file

## :computer:  Machine Learning

In the Rmd file, you can find different ARIMA algorithms applied to the dataset tested for the following criteria:
- Correlogram
- BIC value
- MAE value
- Diebold Mariano test

The objective is to select the best one and do forecasts for the upcomming weeks.
